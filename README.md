Description
-----------

This project is a collection of researches related to sentiment **e**ntity
**r**elation **c**lassification.
Given a mass media russian news articles and list of marked named entities in
it, we may predict a sentiment attitudes -- relation between entities. Each
attitude could be classified as follows: positive, negative, or neutral.
Having a train and test collections of **inosmi.ru** news as a part of
'data.zip' collection, we might applly and compare a different (feature based)
machine learning approaches, such as svm, nb, rf, knn.

Being applyed for unlabeled articles (test collections), we interested only in
non neutral attitudes. As a result, we extract positive and negative attitudes
and discard neutrals.

Dataset
-------

Dataset data presented by `data.zip` archieve. It includes test and train
collections. Each collection consist of mass media articles written in russian.
Each news has list of annotated entites (`*.annot.txt`), and original text.
Additionaly, train collection also includes a list of sentiment (non neutral)
attitudes per each news (`*.opin.txt`). Therefore, each attitude has a `pos` or
`neg` label.

To overcome the issue of multiple name of the same entity (i.e. for example,
[`сша`, `соединенные штаты`], ['рф', 'россия']), dataset also includes list of
synonyms that might be used for news of both collections.

Additional files that become useful for feature values producing are also
included in dataset archieve.

Installation
------------

Using [virtualenv](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-install-virtualenv-python/).
Create virtual environment, suppose `my_env`, and then create and activete it
as follows:
```
virtualenv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```

Use `Makefile` to install necessary dependencies and unpack `data.zip` dataset:
```
make install
```

We use word2vec model which were taken from
[rusvectores](http://rusvectores.org/static/models/rusvectores2/),
Because of some features that depends on words embedding vocabulary, it is
necessary to additionally download a model, as follows:
```
make download_model
```
*Note:* This word embedding model stores a russian terms with additional POS
suffix written in [mystem notation](https://tech.yandex.ru/mystem/doc/grammemes-values-docpage/).

Usage
-----
Being not interested in neutral attitutes, dataset doesn't provide such
information (i.e. attitudes with 'neutral' labels).
For extraction of positive and negative attitudes we additionally introduce
(extract from news) **neutral attudes** to distinguish really sentiment
attitudes from neutral in further.

We compose a list of neutral relations per each news of train an test
collection by running:
```
./neutrals.py
```

Next, compose a list of feature vectors per each attitude of test and train
collection as follows:
```
./vectorize.py
```

Finally we are ready to apply different models by calling:
```
./predict_*.py
```
Where asterics sign ```*``` denotes a pattern matching and group of methods you want,
and here could be `default` (which also includes
[grid](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html) search),
`class_elemination`, `mfs` (model features selection), `rfe` (recursive
features selection), `uv` (univariate)
